    "# 0. Acknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Professor Pamela B. Matheson who taught me Intermediate Statistics at Amherst College for her invaluable feedback and support in drafting the early stages of this project. Her insights were crucial in helping shape the project’s focus and approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of rent is a critical financial consideration for households and a key revenue source for property managers. Understanding the drivers behind rent variations can help property managers price units effectively, and assist policymakers in addressing affordability disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to investigate if some selected factors influence a household's monthly rent. I discovered that household income, the number of rooms in the property, and the household's access to the internet are three significant predictors for monthly rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  How strongly does household income correlate with monthly rent?\n",
    "2)  Does the size of a rented property, as measured by the number of rooms, impact the cost of rent?\n",
    "3)  How does access to the internet relate to rent prices? Are there differences in rent costs for households with or without internet access?\n",
    "4)  Are utility expenses, specifically the monthly costs of gas and electricity, significant predictors of rent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our multiple linear regression model, we tested the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between all the quantitative explanatory variables and monthly rent. We also hypothesized that there is a significant difference between households with different levels of internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes from the American Community Survey (ACS), which is a survey the Census Bureau uses to determine how federal and state funds are distributed in the US. Over 3.5 million households are randomly selected to participate each year, and for this project, we will be using the ACS data collected in 2019. Therefore, the larger population we are addressing in this study is the US population in 2019. For this analysis, we focus on a subset of the survey data that captures essential variables related to household characteristics and monthly rent, encompassing a sample size of 361 observations after data cleaning."

    "\n",
    "Given the dataset’s complexity and some incomplete responses, the following actions were taken to prepare the data for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Handling Missing Values: Observations with missing values in any of the primary variables of interest were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a final dataset with 361 observations.\n",
    "2)  Variable Transformations: Many of the quantitative variables, including household income and the number of rooms, exhibited right-skewed distributions. To improve the model’s fit, these variables were transformed using a square root function, which helped normalize the distributions and satisfy assumptions required for linear regression.\n",
    "3)  Categorical Variables: For the variable related to internet access, initial values were coded into three levels: households paying for internet, households with unpaid access, and households without access. During analysis, we simplified this variable by combining the first two categories (internet access) and leaving the third as a separate category (no internet access) after determining that rent costs were statistically similar between households with paid and unpaid internet access."

    "**Response variable**: Monthly Rent (RNTP), which is a quantitative variable measuring the amount of rent each household pays in a month, in rounded dollar amounts. Among 5000 observations, 1016 observations contain values for Monthly Rent, ranging from 4 dollars to 3900 dollars. After removing all observations missing at least one of our variables, we are left with 361 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory Variables**: For the explanatory variables, values of \"b\" indicate that no occupants were living in the house when the interviewers went there, and values of \"N/A\" meant that data was not available for that question in that household. We removed all observations with missing entries (both \"b\" and \"N/A\") in our explanatory variables from our dataset to fix the size of the models that we later wanted to compare. Therefore, we now have 361 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Number of own children in household (NOC): this is a quantitative variable measuring the unweighted number of children in the household.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Number of Rooms (RMSP): this is a quantitative variable measuring the number of rooms in the unit.\n",

    "3)  Monthly Cost of Gas (GASP): this is a quantitative variable measuring the monthly cost of gas in dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)  Monthly Cost of Electricity (ELEP): this is a quantitative variable measuring the monthly cost of electricity in dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)  Household income (HINCP): this is a quantitative variable measuring the household income (in dollars) in the past 12 months at the time the survey was conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)  Access to to the Internet (ACCESS): this is a categorical variable with 3 levels coded as: (1) payed a cell phone company or Internet service provider for access to the internet, (2) had access to the Internet but did not pay a cell phone company or Internet service provider for it, and (3) do not have access to the Internet. \\## 3.

We looked at the F-statistics and the associated p-value (significantly \\<0.05) returned by the ONE-WAY ANOVA and concluded that there's a significant difference between the levels of Access to the Internet. This led us to conduct a Multiple Comparison Test with Tukey's HSD method to find out how groups differ because Tukey's HSD is the most moderate method we have learned. The result showed that there's a significant difference between level 3 (no access to the Internet), and levels 1 and 2 (both have access to the Internet), but there was no difference between levels 1 and 2. This means that having or not having access to the Internet makes a significant difference in the monthly rent, but there is not a significant difference between households that pay or do not pay a cell phone company or Internet service provider. Therefore, we grouped levels 1 and 2, leaving the variable \"access to internet\" with only two levels, with and without access to the internet.\n",

By looking at the residual vs. fitted plot of the initial model, and the normal-qq plot of the initial model, we realized that the model had significant problems with both constant variance and normality conditions. We then used transformation of the variables with the square root function on all the quantitative variables, since all of them were very right skewed. The conditions are now fairly met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we used another automated variable selection process with the best-subset method. We then conducted a Nested F-test between the two models with the best $R^2$ and Mallow's Cp, which are the model with square root of household income, square root of rooms in the property, and access to internet, and monthly cost of gas versus the same model without monthly cost of gas. The Nested F-test showed that the model with 3 predictors is the better one. We removed three points with unusually high standardized residuals, checked the conditions of constant variance and normality again by looking at residual vs. fitted plots and QQ plots, and we believed that conditions were overall satisfied."

    "Our final model has square root of monthly rent as the response variable, with three predictor variables, square root of rooms in property, square root of household, access to internet. Having accounted for the variance in other predictors, for each additional unit increase in the square root of rooms in the property, on average, the square root of monthly rent is expected to increase by 1.98, and for each additional unit increase in the square root of household income, on average, the square root of monthly rent is expected to increase by 0.028. And, having accounted for the variance in the two quantitative predictors, on average, households without internet access is expected to have lower square root of monthly rent by 6.356, compared to households with internet access.\n",

    "In this project, we were interested in investigating what factors are correlated with monthly rent, and we have found that rooms in the property, household income, and internet access, are three significant factors that can help us predict monthly rent. We have discovered that as the number of rooms and household income increases, monthly rent is expected to increase. And we have discovered that on average, households without internet access can expect lower monthly rent compared to households with internet access. Surprisingly, monthly utility costs such as electricity costs and gas costs are not significant predictors, and so isn't the number of children as well.\n",

    "## 4.3. Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some of the limitations of our model include that it has a low $R^2$ value, which means that it explains a low amount of variance in the response variable, monthly rent. There were a lot of missing information in the original data-set, forcing us to remove a majority of the entries, which is another factor that impairs our model from explaining for more variance in monthly rent. The data-set itself is a huge data-set as well, incorporating over 200 variables. Trying to explain such a complicated issue as monthly rent with only 6 predictor variables is definitely to some extent unwise. So the result of the study should be treated carefully, and not generated to the population, due to the amount of missing information and low explained variance. Something that can be done to improve the model is to incorporate more variables from the data-set, with the hope that more variables would help explain more variability in monthly rent.\n",

    "# 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is important to note that the insights derived in this analysis are based solely on statistical associations observed within a limited dataset from the American Community Survey (2019). As a fundamental principle of statistics, these associations should not be interpreted as causal relationships. The findings suggest patterns and correlations between household characteristics and rent costs; however, they do not imply that any specific factor directly causes changes in rent. Various unobserved variables, such as location, neighborhood amenities, and broader economic conditions, may also play critical roles in determining rent that are not captured in this analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Therefore, while the implications offer potentially useful insights for understanding rental trends, they must be interpreted with caution. Further research with a more comprehensive dataset and methods specifically designed to assess causality would be necessary to validate and expand upon these findings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uncovered several relationships between household characteristics and monthly rent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Income and Rent: Household income was consistently a strong predictor across both the linear and logistic models. Higher-income households tend to pay higher rent, reflecting the economic capacity to afford larger or more desirable properties.\n",
    "2)  Internet Access: Access to the internet was significantly associated with higher rent costs. This finding suggests that internet access may serve as an indicator of housing infrastructure quality or neighborhood desirability.\n",
    "3)  Utility Costs and Number of Rooms: Gas cost, electricity cost, and the number of rooms showed limited significance in predicting rent. Although these factors may influence exact rent values, they do not appear to impact rent in a way that affects overall rent categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2. Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings provide useful insights for companies, renters and policymakers. The insight that monthly utility costs and the number of children in a household don’t significantly impact rent allows companies to focus on factors that do—like household income, property size, and internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The lack of a strong association between monthly utility costs (gas and electricity) and rent suggests that tenants may not necessarily value pre-included utilities as highly as other amenities (e.g., internet access). Property managers and utility companies could consider separate billing for utilities rather than bundling them into rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Since the number of children in a household does not significantly affect rent costs in this analysis, property managers might find that family-oriented marketing doesn’t need to prioritize units based solely on family size but could focus on other appealing features, like neighborhood quality or proximity to schools. Real estate companies and developers could also focus on designing rental units that appeal broadly to all household types rather than specifically targeting family-sized units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Since utilities and household composition (e.g., number of children) do not correlate strongly with rent in this dataset, companies may benefit from prioritizing investments in amenities that show a stronger association with rent. For instance, enhancing internet connectivity or focusing on modern, location-based amenities (such as fitness centers or co-working spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The correlation between internet access and rent suggests that properties in areas with infrastructure for internet may command higher rental prices, potentially creating accessibility barriers for lower-income families. This insight could inform policies aimed at promoting equitable access to affordable housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3. Limitations and Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "The relatively low R-squared value in our linear model indicates that the predictors used explain only a portion of the variance in rent. Furthermore, the logistic model’s moderate sensitivity suggests that additional features may enhance rent classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve model performance and address limitations, we have attempted to add the interaction terms between log_income \\* ACCESS and log_rooms \\* log_income. However, the result did not yield a noticeable improvement in $R^2$. Given the not so impressive outcome and the complication of the new model, we decided to remove the interaction terms and keep the simpler version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Work: To improve the predictive power of these models, future work could incorporate more detailed geographic data, such as neighborhood demographics or proximity to city centers, which may be critical in explaining rent variability. Additionally, exploring non-linear or more complex models (e.g., decision trees or random forests) could capture interactions between predictors that were not addressed in this study."
