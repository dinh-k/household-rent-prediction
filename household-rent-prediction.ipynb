    "# 0. Acknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Professor Pamela B.\n",
    "Matheson who taught me Intermediate Statistics at Amherst College for\n",
    "her invaluable feedback and support in drafting the early stages of this\n",
    "project. Her insights were crucial in helping shape the project’s focus\n",
    "and approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of rent is a critical financial consideration for households\n",
    "and a key revenue source for property managers. Understanding the\n",
    "drivers behind rent variations can help property managers price units\n",
    "effectively, and assist policymakers in addressing affordability\n",
    "disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to investigate if some selected factors influence a\n",
    "household’s monthly rent. I discovered that household income, the number\n",
    "of rooms in the property, and the household’s access to the internet are\n",
    "three significant predictors for monthly rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  How strongly does household income correlate with monthly rent?\n",
    "2.  Does the size of a rented property, as measured by the number of\n",
    "    rooms, impact the cost of rent?\n",
    "3.  How does access to the internet relate to rent prices? Are there\n",
    "    differences in rent costs for households with or without internet\n",
    "    access?\n",
    "4.  Are utility expenses, specifically the monthly costs of gas and\n",
    "    electricity, significant predictors of rent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our multiple linear regression model, we tested the hypothesis that\n",
    "there is a positive correlation between all the quantitative explanatory\n",
    "variables and monthly rent. We also hypothesized that there is a\n",
    "significant difference between households with different levels of\n",
    "internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes from the American Community Survey (ACS), which is a\n",
    "survey the Census Bureau uses to determine how federal and state funds\n",
    "are distributed in the US. Over 3.5 million households are randomly\n",
    "selected to participate each year, and for this project, we will be\n",
    "using the ACS data collected in 2019. Therefore, the larger population\n",
    "we are addressing in this study is the US population in 2019. For this\n",
    "analysis, we focus on a subset of the survey data that captures\n",
    "essential variables related to household characteristics and monthly\n",
    "rent, encompassing a sample size of 361 observations after data\n",

    "    ## 2.2. Data Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the dataset’s complexity and some incomplete responses, the following actions were taken to prepare the data for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1)  Handling Missing Values: Observations with missing values in any of the primary variables of interest were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a final dataset with 361 observations.\n",
    "    2)  Variable Transformations: Many of the quantitative variables, including household income and the number of rooms, exhibited right-skewed distributions. To improve the model’s fit, these variables were transformed using a square root function, which helped normalize the distributions and satisfy assumptions required for linear regression.\n",
    "    3)  Categorical Variables: For the variable related to internet access, initial values were coded into three levels: households paying for internet, households with unpaid access, and households without access. During analysis, we simplified this variable by combining the first two categories (internet access) and leaving the third as a separate category (no internet access) after determining that rent costs were statistically similar between households with paid and unpaid internet access.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanatory Variables**: For the explanatory variables, values of “b”\n",
    "indicate that no occupants were living in the house when the\n",
    "interviewers went there, and values of “N/A” meant that data was not\n",
    "available for that question in that household. We removed all\n",
    "observations with missing entries (both “b” and “N/A”) in our\n",
    "explanatory variables from our dataset to fix the size of the models\n",

    "    suggests that more rooms slightly increase the likelihood of high\n",
    "    rent. However, this predictor is not statistically significant (p =\n",

    "    well as the number of rooms, do not have a strong impact on the\n",
    "    classification of high vs. low rent. This result might suggest that\n",
    "    utility costs and room count do not significantly influence the rent\n",
    "    classification in this dataset, though they could impact exact rent\n",

    "## 5.4. Limitations\n",

    "-   Limited Predictive Power: The model’s low sensitivity (32%)\n",

    "\n",
    "# 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is important to note that the insights derived in this analysis are\n",
    "based solely on statistical associations observed within a limited\n",
    "dataset from the American Community Survey (2019). As a fundamental\n",
    "principle of statistics, these associations should not be interpreted as\n",
    "causal relationships. The findings suggest patterns and correlations\n",
    "between household characteristics and rent costs; however, they do not\n",
    "imply that any specific factor directly causes changes in rent. Various\n",
    "unobserved variables, such as location, neighborhood amenities, and\n",
    "broader economic conditions, may also play critical roles in determining\n",
    "rent that are not captured in this analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Therefore, while the implications offer potentially useful insights for\n",
    "understanding rental trends, they must be interpreted with caution.\n",
    "Further research with a more comprehensive dataset and methods\n",
    "specifically designed to assess causality would be necessary to validate\n",
    "and expand upon these findings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uncovered several relationships between household\n",
    "characteristics and monthly rent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Income and Rent: Household income was consistently a strong\n",
    "    predictor across both the linear and logistic models. Higher-income\n",
    "    households tend to pay higher rent, reflecting the economic capacity\n",
    "    to afford larger or more desirable properties.\n",
    "2.  Internet Access: Access to the internet was significantly associated\n",
    "    with higher rent costs. This finding suggests that internet access\n",
    "    may serve as an indicator of housing infrastructure quality or\n",
    "    neighborhood desirability.\n",
    "3.  Utility Costs and Number of Rooms: Gas cost, electricity cost, and\n",
    "    the number of rooms showed limited significance in predicting rent.\n",
    "    Although these factors may influence exact rent values, they do not\n",
    "    appear to impact rent in a way that affects overall rent\n",
    "    categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2. Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings provide useful insights for companies, renters and\n",
    "policymakers. The insight that monthly utility costs and the number of\n",
    "children in a household don’t significantly impact rent allows companies\n",
    "to focus on factors that do—like household income, property size, and\n",
    "internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The lack of a strong association between monthly utility costs (gas\n",
    "    and electricity) and rent suggests that tenants may not necessarily\n",
    "    value pre-included utilities as highly as other amenities (e.g.,\n",
    "    internet access). Property managers and utility companies could\n",
    "    consider separate billing for utilities rather than bundling them\n",
    "    into rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Since the number of children in a household does not significantly\n",
    "    affect rent costs in this analysis, property managers might find\n",
    "    that family-oriented marketing doesn’t need to prioritize units\n",
    "    based solely on family size but could focus on other appealing\n",
    "    features, like neighborhood quality or proximity to schools. Real\n",
    "    estate companies and developers could also focus on designing rental\n",
    "    units that appeal broadly to all household types rather than\n",
    "    specifically targeting family-sized units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Since utilities and household composition (e.g., number of children)\n",
    "    do not correlate strongly with rent in this dataset, companies may\n",
    "    benefit from prioritizing investments in amenities that show a\n",
    "    stronger association with rent. For instance, enhancing internet\n",
    "    connectivity or focusing on modern, location-based amenities (such\n",
    "    as fitness centers or co-working spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The correlation between internet access and rent suggests that\n",
    "    properties in areas with infrastructure for internet may command\n",
    "    higher rental prices, potentially creating accessibility barriers\n",
    "    for lower-income families. This insight could inform policies aimed\n",
    "    at promoting equitable access to affordable housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3. Limitations and Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "The relatively low R-squared value in our linear model indicates that\n",
    "the predictors used explain only a portion of the variance in rent.\n",
    "Furthermore, the logistic model’s moderate sensitivity suggests that\n",
    "additional features may enhance rent classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve model performance and address limitations, we have attempted\n",
    "to add the interaction terms between log_income \\* ACCESS and log_rooms\n",
    "\\* log_income. However, the result did not yield a noticeable\n",
    "improvement in $R^2$. Given the not so impressive outcome and the\n",
    "complication of the new model, we decided to remove the interaction\n",
    "terms and keep the simpler version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Work: To improve the predictive power of these models, future\n",
    "work could incorporate more detailed geographic data, such as\n",
    "neighborhood demographics or proximity to city centers, which may be\n",
    "critical in explaining rent variability. Additionally, exploring\n",
    "non-linear or more complex models (e.g., decision trees or random\n",
    "forests) could capture interactions between predictors that were not\n",
    "addressed in this study."
